# Matryoshka Vending Machine - THREE.js + React

My project for the April 2024 [Three.js Journey Challenge 010](https://threejs-journey.com/challenges/vending-machine), got ðŸ¥‰ 3rd place.

The theme is **Vending Machine**.

I've created an interactive vending machine that sells smaller vending machine and chips.
